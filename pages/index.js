I&#8217;ll be sure to note that in my log. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Now we know what they mean by &#8216;advanced&#8217; tactical training. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.</p>\n',

Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. You&#8217;re going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. You bet I&#8217;m agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.</p>\n',

I recommend you don&#8217;t fire until you&#8217;re within 40,000 kilometers. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I&#8217;ll be sure to note that in my log. I am your worst nightmare! We have a saboteur aboard.</p>\n',
